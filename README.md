> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to add new features that don't require editing other packages other than `pro.sketchware`, make your changes in `pro.sketchware` package, and respect the directories and files structure and names. Also, even though the project compiles just fine with Kotlin classes that you might add, try to make your changes or additions in Java, not Kotlin unless it is more than necessary.

## Thanks for Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Sketchware Pro! Your contributions help keep Sketchware Pro alive. Each accepted contribution will be noted down in the "About Team" activity. We'll use your GitHub name and profile picture initially, but they can be changed, of course.

## Disclaimer

This mod was not created for any harmful purposes, such as harming Sketchware; quite the opposite, actually. It was made to keep Sketchware alive by the community for the community. Please use it at your own discretion.

We do NOT permit publishing Sketchware Pro as it is, or with modifications, on Play Store or on any other app store. Keep in mind that this project is still a mod. Unauthorized modding of apps is considered illegal and we discourage such behavior.

We love Sketchware very much and are grateful to Sketchware's developers for creating such an amazing app. However, we haven't received updates for a long time. That's why we decided to keep Sketchware alive by creating this mod, and it's completely free. We don't demand any money :)
